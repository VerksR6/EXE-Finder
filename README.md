# EXE-Finder
 **Verks’ EXE Finder** is a simple Windows batch tool that scans common user folders to list game and app `.exe` files in a text file. It scans user files only, does not modify, delete, or run files, and collects no data. Safe to use — **NOT a virus**. Run the `.bat`, press `1` to scan, then use CTRL+F to search.
